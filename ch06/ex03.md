# Will these work? 

```
1)
max (length [1, 2, 3])
    (length [8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
-> 5

This should work. Length returns an Int which has an instance of Ord

2)
compare (3 * 4) (3 * 5)
-> LT
This should work. Multiplication returns an instance Num which is orderable

3) 
compare "Julie" True

This won't work because compare requires two arguments of the same type
compare :: a -> a -> Ordering

4) 
(5 + 3) > (3 + 6)
-> False

Yes this will work. Greater than takes two arguments two values that are instances of Num 
```
