# fold practice

```
1) 
foldr (*) 1 [1..5]
will return the same as
b) foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..5]
AND
c) foldl (*) 1 [1..5]

because multiplication is associative

2) evaluate 
> foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3]
-- let f = (flip (*))
> foldl f 1 [1..3]
> foldl f (f 1 1) [2..3]
> foldl f (f (f 1 1) 2) [3]
> foldl f (f (f (f 1 1) 2) 3) []
-- base case reached. return acc and then force evaluation
> (f (f (f 1 1) 2) 3)
> (f (f (1 * 1) 2) 3)
> (f (f 1 2) 3)
> (f (2 * 1) 3)
> (f 2 3)
> (3 * 2)
> 6

3) one difference between foldr and foldl is
c) foldr associates to the right

4) folds are generally used to a) reduce structure

5)
a) should be
foldr (++) "" ["woot", "Woot", "woot"]

b)
foldr max ' ' "fear is the little death"

c)
foldr (&&) True [False, True]

d) in order to be able to return True or False, you must change the base
case to false
foldr (||) False [False, True]

e)
foldl (\x y -> x ++ (show y)) "" [1..5]

f) 
foldr const 'a' ['1'..'5']

g)
foldr const '0' "tacos"

h)
foldl (flip const) '0' "burritos"

i)
foldl (flip const) 'z' ['1'..'5']
```
