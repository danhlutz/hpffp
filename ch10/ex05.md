# the secret function

figure out what this function does

```
seekritFunc x =
  div (sum (map length (words x)))
      (length (words x))
```

This function finds the average length of the words in a string. 

In the first argument to div, it uses words to break up the string
into a list of individual word strings. 
Then it finds the length of each word string, and adds up the total length. 
Then it divides by the number of words

Because the function uses "div" instead of "/" it gives the average as an
Int instead of Fractional

Type information:
seekritFunc :: String -> Int
