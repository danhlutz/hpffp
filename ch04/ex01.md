# a sample type declaration

```
data Mood = Blah | Woot deriving Show

1. The name of the type is Mood

2. The possible values are Blah or Woot

3. Fix this type signature

We first wrote
changeMood :: Mood -> Woot

But this does not show the type that is returned by the function. Woot is a value not a type. To correct it use:

changeMood :: Mood -> Mood

4. Fix this function 

We orignally gave
changeMood Mood = Woot
changeMood    _ = Blah

This is wrong because the parameter passed to the first instance of changeMood should be a value, not a type. To fix it use: 

changeMood Blah = Woot
changeMood    _ = Blah
```
