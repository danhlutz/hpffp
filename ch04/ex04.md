# Chapter exercises

```
1. the type of length should be something like

length :: [a] -> Int

it takes one argument, a list, and it evaluates to an Int

(Note, when I run :t length in the GHCi I get: 
length :: Foldable t => t a -> Int

2. 
a. length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5

b. length [(1, 2), (2, 3) (3, 4)]
3

c. length allAwesome
2

d. length (concat allAwesome)
5

3. 6 / length [1, 2, 3]
returns an error because the type of applying length to [1, 2, 3] is an Int

4. you can fix the error above by using quot or div. This will work

div 6 $ length [1, 2, 3]

5. What is the type of  2 + 3 == 5? 
True :: Bool

6. What is the type and expected result of the following

> let x = 5
> x + 3 == 5
False :: Bool

7. Which will work? 

> length allAwesome == 2
This will work

> length [1, 'a', 3, 'b']
This will error. The items of a list must be the same type

> length allAwesome + length awesome
This will work because length returns an Int

> (8 == 8) && ('b' < 'a')
This will work because the result of each subexpression returns type Bool

> (8 == 8) && 9
This will not work because && :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
```
