# Syntax errors

Will these raise syntax errors? 

```
1. ++ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

Yes. An infix operator must be wrapped in parentheses to turn it 
into a prefix operator.

The correct form would be
(++) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

2. 
'<3' ++ ' Haskell'

Yes. A String must be quoted using double quotes. 

The correct form would be
"<3" + " Haskell"

3. 
concat ["<3", "Haskell"]

This will not raise syntax errors.
```
