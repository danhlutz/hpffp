```
1. 
a. concat [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Yes, this is correct. concat takes a list of lists made up of items of the same type and returns one list with those items. 

b. ++ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

No this will not work. ++ is an infix operator and must be wrapped in parentheses to be used prefix, like this. 

(++) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]

c. (++) "hello" " world"

Yes, this will fix. The operator is properly parenthesized. 

d. ["hello" ++ " world]

No, this will not work. It is missing a trailing quote mark, like this: 
["hello" ++ " world"]

e. 4 !! "hello"

this is written in the wrong order, it should be:
"hello" !! 4

f. (!!) "hello" 4

Yes, this will work. 

g. take "4 lovely"

No this will not work because it requires two arguments, but this will: 
take 4 "lovely"

h. take 3 "awesome"

Yes, this will work.
