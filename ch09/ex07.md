# return a value? 

```
1) 
[ x ^ y | x <- [1..5], y <- [2, undefined] ]

this expression will raise an error when it is evaluated
because y is not fully defined

2)
take 1 $
  [x ^ y | x <- [1..5], y [2, undefined ]]

This does not raise an error

3) 
sum [1, undefined, 3]

This will raise an error because sum needs the value of every element
in the list

4) length [1, 2, undefined]

This will not error because length does not evaluate the 
cells of a list, just its spine

5) 
length $ [1, 2, 3] ++ undefined

This will error because the value of a cell to be appended is needed

6) take 1 $ filter even [1, 2, 3, undefined]

This does not error because it only pulls the first even number

7) 
take 1 $ filter even [1, 3, undefined]

This will error because take will force evaluation until it finds
an even number, but there are no evens before it will reach
the undefined value

8) 
take 1 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]

This will not error because it pulls the first number from the list

9)
take 2 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]

This will not error because it just pulls the first two numbers from the
list

10)
take 3 $ filter [1, 3, undefined]

This will error because the third element is undefined
